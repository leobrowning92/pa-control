# Agillent 4156c Parameter Analyzer control and data axquisition


## Overview


The idea of this project is to improve how we interface with our
Agillent 4156c Parameter Analyzer, both for command and data handling, in order
to improve measurement efficiency

This work is covered under the MIT open License. If you use or are inspired by this work, please be in touch!

## Usage

* The file gui.bat is for running the gui on the lab computer (Windows 7).
the gui allows the saving of data from the parameter analyzer




## To Do
- test new download functionality.
- move all of the functions in parameter_analyser.py into hp4156c as methods.
    - then parameter_analyser.py can contain only run sequences as is currently the case for cntrun.py
