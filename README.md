# pa-control
##Overview
The idea of this project is to improve how we interface with the 
Parameter analyzer, both for command and data handling, in order
to improve measurement efficiency




##DIRECTORIES



#pulldata
Includes the files         
to allow removal of data from the PA and simmple processing for FET
measurements but with no control of the pa from the computer.                       
All sweeps must be run and saved manually.
