# pa-control


## Overview


The idea of this project is to improve how we interface with the
Parameter analyzer, both for command and data handling, in order
to improve measurement efficiency

## Usage

* The file gui.bat is for running the gui on the lab computer (Windows 7).
the gui allows the saving of data from the parameter analyzer




## To Do
- test new download functionality.
- move all of the functions in parameter_analyser.py into hp4156c as methods.
    - then parameter_analyser.py can contain only run sequences as is currently the case for cntrun.py
